in OracleDB there are 2 super users: system and sys
they have a password 'oracle'
--> conn user/password
If you cannot connect to the session: close the terminal and wait to see on the window "Username?"
How to check with which user you are connected: SHOW USER;
--> alter session set container=cdb$root;
--> alter database open;
To get the needed disk space to archive DB 
--> select sum(sum_bytes)/1024/1024 m_bytes from ( select sum(bytes) sum_bytes from v$datafile union select sum(bytes) sum_bytes from v$tempfile union select (sum(bytes) * members) sum_bytes from v$log group by members);
Information for files and their location
--> select name from v$datafile union select name from v$controlfile union select name from v$tempfile union select member from v$logfile;
